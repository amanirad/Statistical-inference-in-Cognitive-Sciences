# Statistical-inference-in-Cognitive-Sciences

The current repository for the projects of the statistical inference course in cognitive sciences in the second semester of 2022 at Shahid Beheshti University (SBU). Five projects are defined here that all students should complete all five projects with full details in the same Jupyter Notebook R file related to that project (codes and descriptions-interpretations of the codes, as well as conclusions, should be carefully added together in that file). Data for each project is uploaded here.

As soon as the projects are completed, please zip all five files of your project and send them to j.amanirad@gmail.com.
